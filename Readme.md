## Data Structures

This section includes Python implementations of commonly used data structures, such as:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Hash Table
- Graph
- and more...

Each data structure is accompanied by example code and explanations to help you understand their usage and implementation.

## Algorithms

This section covers various algorithms implemented in Python, including:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming
- and more...

Each algorithm is explained with code examples and step-by-step explanations to help you grasp the underlying concepts.

## Usage

To use the code examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Open the desired Python file containing the data structure or algorithm you want to explore.
4. Run the Python file using your preferred Python interpreter.

Feel free to modify the code examples or add your own implementations to further enhance your understanding.
